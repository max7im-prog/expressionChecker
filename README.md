# Expression Checker

This repository contains the source code for the **Expression Checker**, developed during the **МИРЭА АТОМ Hackathon** in December 2024 by the team **"Котики"**.

## Overview

The tools developed during the hackathon allow you to check if mathematical expressions can be simplified to the same expression. This functionality is useful for evaluating mathematical formulas and ensuring their consistency.

## Repository Contents

- **Source Code**: The implementation of the expression checking and simplification algorithm.
- **Test Cases**: A set of test cases to validate the functionality of the expression checker.

## Docker Container

You can find the Docker container with the entire application on the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/r-4spberry/kotiki.2024.docker).
